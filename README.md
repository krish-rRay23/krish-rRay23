## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

**Hochschule Zittau/Görlitz (IPM)** — Research Intern, Robotics & AI (Zittau, Germany) · Jun 2025 – Aug 2025

* Designed and implemented an end-to-end ROS2 system (LIMO Pro + MyCobot280 + Orbbec camera + YOLO) for autonomous exploration and manipulation.
* Developed SLAM-based exploration, depth→map transforms, interrupt-safe mission controller, and robust pick-and-place pipelines — achieved **>95%** pick reliability during lab validation.
* Delivered production-grade integration: TF2 transforms, Nav2 waypoints, AMCL tuning, and voice/telemetry feedback.

**TechSolvo LLP** — Software Developer Intern (Indore, India) · Jun 2024 – Aug 2024

* Built and deployed a Django-based AI Resume Builder with PDF export and PostgreSQL backend.
* Implemented web-scraping pipelines (Selenium, BeautifulSoup), optimized backend APIs, and reduced data processing latency by **~70%**.

## SELECTED PROJECTS

**DogBot — ROS2 Autonomous Mobile Manipulator** · Jul 2025

* Full ROS2 Foxy implementation: SLAM exploration, YOLOv8 detection fused with depth, 3D-to-map conversion, Nav2 waypoint navigation, and MyCobot pick/drop state machine.
* Features: detection filtering, repeat suppression, pose stamping, mission interruption handling.

**Agentic AI Orchestrator** · Aug 2025

* Architected a multi-agent orchestration platform combining LangGraph, LangChain, CrewAI and Autogen for automated task planning, execution, and monitoring.

**Edge Deepfake Detection System** · Jan 2026

* Designed lightweight TinyCNN student model distilled from LaDeDa, patch-level logits aggregated via mean + top-K pooling; optimized with TensorFlow Lite 8-bit quantization for edge inference.

**AI Resume Builder (Full-Stack)** · Aug 2024

* Django web app with secure auth, responsive UI, PDF resume generation, and automated keyword-optimized scraping for role tailoring.
